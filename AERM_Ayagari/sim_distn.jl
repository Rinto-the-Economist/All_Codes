# This file contains the iterative solver for the stationary distribution. It first transforms the asset policy 
# matrix into a transition matrix. This is a mapping between the current and next period's asset holdings.
# Then, it combines this transition matrix with the income transition matrix to produce a mapping between 
# an income-asset pair in the current period and an income-asset pair in the next period. Finally, 
# it iteratively solves for a stationary distribution Î¼(b,y).
#
# The inputs are:
# - sol_v: a named tuple containing the solution to the value function
# - x_int: an initial guess for the distribution
# - params: a named tuple containing the model parameters
#
# The outputs are:
# - trans_mat: the transition matrix
# - x_ss: the stationary distribution
