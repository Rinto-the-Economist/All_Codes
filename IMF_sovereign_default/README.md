This folder contains the MATLAB code to my solution to Problem Set 2 of the International Macroeconomics and Finance course, described in pset_sovdef.pdf. This is a two-period sovereign default model with risk-neutral lenders. The files are:
- sovereign_default.m: this file solves for the equilibrium and outputs the policy function
- sovereign_default_Q4.m: this file runs sovereign_default.m under different risk aversion assumptions for the lender
- 1068576_IMF___Problem_Set_2-2.pdf: contains all results and my interpretation
