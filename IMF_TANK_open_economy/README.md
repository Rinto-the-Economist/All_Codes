This folder contains the MATLAB Dynare codes to my answer to the International Macroeconomics and Finance Exam, as described in IntMacroFin_exam_2023.pdf. All .mod files contain 2 open-economy models consisting of a small open economy and an oil exporter, with the aim of comparing the effects of an oil shock under different assumptions on households heterogeneity and price rigidity. The folders are as follow:
- PS4.m: the main file, which loads the parameters, runs all auxiliary files and produce the graphs and figures
- RANBFP.mod: a Representative Agent, Financial Autarky, Flexible Prices NK model
- RANBFP.mod: Representative Agent, Nominal Bond, Flexible Prices NK model
- TANBFP.mod: Two Agents, Nominal Bond, Flexible Prices NK model
- TANBNR.mod: Two Agents, Nominal Bond, Nominal Rigidities NK model
- TANBFPNH.mod: Two Agents, Nominal Bond, Nominal Rigidities, Non-Homothetic preferences NK model
- parameters.m: the common set of parameters
- 1068576_IMF_FINAL.pdf: the model outputs and the interpretation of the results
