This folder contains the code to my answers to Problem Set 3 of the International Macroeconomics and Finance course, as described in PS3_2023-2.pdf. The assignment consists of a replication of Mendoza, Quadrini and Rios-Rull (2007), which models a small open economy with ex-ante identical households subject to ininsurable income shocks. The files are:
- PS3.m: the main file, which runs all auxiliary files and produces graphs and figures
- PS3Q4.m: computes the steady-state and equilibrium interest rate under the assumption of financial autarky using the endogenous grid method. It also outputs the policy functions for consumption and savings, as well as the wealth distribution.
- PS3Q5.m: same as PS3Q4 but under the assumption that savings in the rest of the world is now positive.
- PS3Q6.m: same as PSQ4 but with endogenous public spending instead of taxation
- ar.m: fits an AR(1) process on time series for calibration
- *.xlxs: FRED time series for calibration
- 1068576 - IMF_Problem_Set_3.pdf: summary of the results and interpretation
