This folder contains the Matlab Dynare code to my solution to Problem Set 1 of the International Macroeconomics and Finance course. The problem set is a replication of Gali and Monacelli (2005), which is an open-economy New Keynesian model under different monetary policy assumptions. It contains, in particular:
- problem_set.m: the main file
- optimal.mod: assume the optimal monetary policy (CB minimises loss function)
- ditr.mod: assume the central bank targets domestic inflation
- citr.mod: assume the central bank targets CPI inflation (i.e. both imported and domestic goods inflation)
- peg1/2: assume an exchange rate peg

The results and interpretation are summarised in IMF__Problem_Set_1.pdf.
